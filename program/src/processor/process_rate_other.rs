    // Step 1: Issue a MixContentRecord for mixing init content and buddy candidate's content
    // Step 2: after receive content's link from buddy candidate, put amount of rating point on buddy candidate
    // Step 3: that point need to turn the new minting RFT by first kicker and coordinator's input

    // --for the second rating--
    // the procedure is almost the same as the first rating
    // What's different is that system computes various INDEX on basis of CandidateLimitRecord and RateOtherRecord
    // If conditions are right, OutsideBuyerRecord would be issued for selling the exceeded rate token
